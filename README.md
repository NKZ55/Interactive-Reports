# 🧪 Interactive User Research Reports

Welcome to the **Interactive User Research Reports** repository! This repo hosts a collection of interactive reports generated from user research projects. It is designed to make qualitative insights more accessible, engaging, and actionable for designers, product teams, and stakeholders.

## 🔍 Purpose

Traditional user research outputs (e.g., static slide decks or long-form documents) can be hard to navigate and digest. This project explores how to transform rich user data—such as interviews, observations, and surveys—into dynamic, interactive formats that support deeper understanding and faster decision-making.

## 📁 What’s Inside

* **Interactive Reports** – Web-based reports with filters, visual summaries, quotes, and key insights.
* **Raw Data Samples** – Anonymized transcripts, notes, or code frameworks.
* **Analysis Tools** – Scripts or templates used to generate the interactive reports.
* **Documentation** – Methodology and design rationale.

## 💡 Use Cases

* Share findings with stakeholders in a more engaging way
* Drill down into specific user segments or behaviors
* Facilitate data-driven discussions in product and design teams

## 🛠️ Built With

*(Replace or remove depending on actual stack used)*

* HTML / CSS / JavaScript
* React / D3.js / Observable
* Python / Jupyter Notebooks
* Airtable / Notion API integrations

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome—whether it's adding a new report format, improving the interactivity, or suggesting features. Feel free to open issues or pull requests.
